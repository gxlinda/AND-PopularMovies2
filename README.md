# AND-PopularMovies
Popular movies project for Android Developer Nanodegree at Udacity

IMPORTANT: To fetch popular movies, you will use the API from themoviedb.org. To use the 
API you need a personal API key, which can be requested from the themoviedb.org website.

Once you obtain your key, you append it to your HTTP request as a URL parameter like so:
http://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular?api_key=[YOUR_API_KEY]
Please enter your API key into gradle.properties
